Adenosis is a benign (non-cancerous) breast condition in which the lobules (milk-producing glands) are enlarged, and there are more glands than usual. Adenosis is often found in biopsy samples of women who have fibrocystic changes in their breasts.

A fibroadenoma is a solid breast lump, which happens most often between ages 15 and 35. Fibroadenomas are common, benign (non-cancerous) breast tumors made up of both glandular tissue and stromal (connective) tissue.

Phyllodes tumors (or phylloides tumors) are rare breast tumors that start in the connective (stromal) tissue of the breast, not the ducts or glands (which is where most breast cancers start). 

Tubular adenomas are the most common polyps found in your colon. Tubular adenomas are usually harmless, but they sometimes can turn cancerous.

Ductal carcinoma is a type of tumor that primarily presents in the ducts of a gland. Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a condition that affects the cells of the milk ducts in the breast. 

Lobular carcinoma is a type of breast cancer that begins in the milk-producing glands (lobules) of the breast. The five-year survival rate for invasive lobular carcinoma is high compared to other types of cancer â€” nearly 100% when treated early.

Mucinous carcinoma is a rare type of cancer, which starts in the main cells of mucus, called mucin. Mucinous carcinoma is often less aggressive than other cancer types and responds well to treatment.

Papillary carcinoma is the most common form of well-differentiated thyroid cancer, and the most common form of thyroid cancer to result from exposure to radiation. Papillary carcinoma appears as an irregular solid or cystic mass or nodule in a normal thyroid parenchyma.

Surgery, radiation therapy, hormone therapy and targeted therapy can treat or cure cancer.
